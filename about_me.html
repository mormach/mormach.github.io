        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro box1"> I grew up in Minnesota where my father, when he was not busy with work, would teach me much about computers. However, my parents got divorced and my mom and I moved to North Carolina alone. My dad stayed in Minnesota, but I had to visit him frequently. I took a few years post-high school to focus on myself, but then I decided to pursue a degree at Wake Tech when I got married to my wife, Fae.<img src="assets/MorganLogo256.png" alt="" width="256" height="256" class="FloatLeft"><br>

  <br>
My childhood in Minnesota was great, but the move to North Carolina was not easy, especially with the added stress of my parents' divorce and being away from my father. My mom, who was a bus driver when I was younger, is now a teacher. She was a great support for me during this time, and I was able to adjust to a new place and a new lifestyle. However, I made the most of my time and tried to focus on myself and my personal growth.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Attending Wake Tech was a great opportunity for me to pursue my education and develop my skills in a new and exciting environment. I was able to learn from experienced professionals and gain hands-on experience in my field of interest. It was a great opportunity for me to gain new skills, network with peers and industry professionals, and build a foundation for my future career. <br>
          Overall, my journey has been an exciting and fulfilling one, and I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that I have had. I'm excited to continue my education, and I'm committed to building a successful career in the field of programming and development.</p>
